Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a standard medical image analysis technique that gives useful information for brain tumor diagnosis. 
One of the most influential and critical aspects of the brain tumor treatment procedure is determining the type of brain tumor. 
For successful treatment of brain tumors, accurate detection of tumors in earlier stages is essential which aids in saving a patientâ€™s life. 
The nature of tumor cells makes the task of classification of brain tumors quite challenging for radiologists. 
Deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have proven to be useful for the image-based classification of tumors. 
CNN is intended to extract features from the MRI scan image adaptively during the training process. 
A variety of layers that form the building blocks of a CNN architecture are utilized to fulfill the task of feature extraction and classification. 
These layers are convolutional layers, pooling layers, batch normalization layers, fully connected layers and dropout layers. 
This research emphasizes the CNN model's efficacy in classifying MRI images of primary brain tumors, specifically glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumor.
